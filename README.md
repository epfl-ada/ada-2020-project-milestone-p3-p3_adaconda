# Enhancing predicition of civil war onset with terrosism dataset and neural network model

## abstract (~150 words) PAUL
The examined civil war paper shows that most models developed to date show poor performance at predicting civil war onset in out-of-sample data. This project will explore an extension of the work and analysis done in the civil war paper with the goal of enhancing the predictions. The project will be two-fold. First, a model based on artificial neural networks will be implemented and evaluated on the original dataset. Secondly, data from the Global Terrorism Database will be added to the features of the prediction model and a performance-evaluation will be performed to assess the utility of the terrorism data. Indeed, the hypothesis put forth by the authors:
> There is a correlation between terrorism attacks and civil war.



## research question(s) 
Can we enhance the predicition power on civil war onset by adding additional features, such as terrorism data ?
Can training artificial neural network improve prediction results compared to random forest ?


## proposed data set GREG
1. terrorist attack data set (to merge with CWD)
	https://gtd.terrorismdata.com/
2. civil war data set

## methods GREG
1. add features to civil war data set to enhance model and predicitons
2. apply artificial neural network to the CDW, and extended data set
	neural network is a prediction method in the same family as random tree, so flexible

ROC plot -> neural network vs RF / more or less features
cross validation

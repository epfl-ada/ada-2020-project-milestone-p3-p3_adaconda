# Enhancing predicition of civil war onset with terrosism dataset and neural network model

## abstract (~150 words)
hypothesis : there is a correlation between terrorism and civil war.

## research question(s)
Can we enhance the predicition power on civil war onset by adding additional features, such as terrorism data ?
Can training artificial neural network improve prediction results compared to random forest ?


## proposed data set
1. terrorist attack data set (to merge with CWD)

2. civil war data set

## methods
1. add features to civil war data set to enhance model and predicitons
2. apply artificial neural network to the CDW, and extended data set
	neural network is a prediction method in the same family as random tree, so flexible

ROC plot -> neural network vs RF / more or less features
cross validation

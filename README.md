# Enhancing predicition of civil war onset with terrosism dataset and neural network model

## Abstract
The examined civil war paper shows that most models developed to date show poor performance at predicting civil war onset in out-of-sample data. This project will explore an extension of the work and analysis done in the civil war paper with the goal of enhancing the predictions. The project will be two-fold. First, a model based on artificial neural networks (ANN) will be implemented and evaluated on the original dataset. Secondly, data from the Global Terrorism Database will be added to the original features of the prediction model. The original dataset (civil war) spans from 1945 to 2000 while the added dataset (terrorism) spans from 1970 to 2018. For simplicity, the model will be developed on data from 1970 to 2000. A performance-evaluation will be performed to assess the utility of the terrorism data. Indeed, the hypothesis put forth by the authors:
> There exist a correlation between terrorist attacks and civil war onset.

The new, enhanced model will be evaluated using ROC-curves and other relevant machine learning (specifically ANN) metrics.


## research question(s) 
Can we enhance the predicition power on civil war onset by adding additional features, such as terrorism data ?
Can training artificial neural network improve prediction results compared to random forest ?


## proposed data set GREG
1. terrorist attack data set (to merge with CWD)
	https://gtd.terrorismdata.com/
2. civil war data set

## methods GREG
1. add features to civil war data set to enhance model and predicitons
2. apply artificial neural network to the CDW, and extended data set
	neural network is a prediction method in the same family as random tree, so flexible

ROC plot -> neural network vs RF / more or less features
cross validation
